                    <p>
                        Ecllipses is an Egyptian Lunar Candle brand that focuses on organic essential oils and hand-crafted aromas.
                        The name of the brand is a combination of the two words "eclipse", as in a solar eclipse, and "ellipse", a sign of suspense or a pause within written text.
                        What the combination is meant to mean, is that these candles are best at providing a sense of stability and calmness upon celestial coincedences.

                        We have various different scented candles, with the Lavender Vanilla scented candle being our most popular (shown left). 
                        We highly recommend our more expensive (but totally worth it) night-harvested lotus candle. It is farmed within a greenhouse in Egypt, during the night.

                        To get into detail, our candles are made with palm wax, a natural and clean wax that lasts for a very long time. 
                        Palm wax is not the most eco-friendly option of candle wax, so we do our part to help reciprocate our thanks to the environment by using biodegradable waste in our lids.

                        Currently, our candles are made in only one size, one which we would call medium large. Our full-scale size selection will come down the road, featuring the following sizes:
                        Small, Medium-small, Medium, Medium-large, and Large. We could also name them after the phases of the moon, but we feel that would make gifting a candle size hard to figure out.

                        For the price below, you get a standard, 300-gram candle that (with its palm wax and cotton wicks) lasts for 70 hours of high-quality burn time.
                        We try to aim for a 2-to-1 ratio with our standard candles, where each dollar grants you 2 hours of soothing scents.
                        Our candles are also hand-poured not to be overwhelmingly potent, so everyone can enjoy a background smell nearby as opposed to a pungent fragrance.
